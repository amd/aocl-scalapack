# AOCL-ScaLAPACK

AOCL-ScaLAPACK is a library of high-performance linear algebra routines for 
parallel distributed memory machines. It can be used to solve linear systems, 
least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. 

AOCL-ScaLAPACK is forked from upstream Netlib ScaLAPACK GitHub 
[repository](https://github.com/Reference-ScaLAPACK/scalapack). This fork has 
ScaLAPACK optimized for AMD “Zen” core based processors. It depends on external 
libraries BLAS and LAPACK. For AMD CPUs, use of AOCL-BLIS and AOCL-libFLAME is 
recommended.

For detailed instructions on how to configure, build, install, and link against
AOCL-ScaLAPACK on AMD CPUs, please refer to the AOCL User Guide located on AMD
developer [portal](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/aocl.html).

For any issues/suggestion in the "amd" fork of ScaLAPACK, please email
toolchainsupport@amd.com.

Also, please read the LICENSE file for information on copying and distributing
this software.
